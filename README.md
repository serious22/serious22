## 🚀 What I Do

### 💡 AI Engineering (LLMs + Agents)
- Build hybrid AI systems combining **Text-to-SQL**, **RAG**, and **LLM reasoning**  
- Architect high-performance **FastAPI** backends for conversational and autonomous agents  
- Optimize retrieval with **vector databases** (FAISS, Pinecone, ChromaDB) and **Redis caching**  
- Design **multi-agent orchestration workflows** using n8n, mirroring LangGraph-style stateful logic  

### 📊 Data Engineering & Data Science
- Develop scalable **data pipelines** for structured + unstructured data  
- Automate KPI dashboards and reporting workflows (Power Automate, Python)  
- Build ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- Perform statistical analysis (Event Study, hypothesis testing)
